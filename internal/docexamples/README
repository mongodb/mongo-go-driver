Go Driver Documentation Examples
================================

examples.go contains numerous documentation examples that are rendered in various locations on www.mongodb.com/docs.
Each example is delineated with starting and ending comments (// Start/End Example #). All examples in examples.go
are valid Go driver code. Each example is run as part of our CI with examples_test.go, so all code is up-to-date and
accurate. We recommend using www.mongodb.com/docs to interact with these examples rather than viewing these files
directly.
